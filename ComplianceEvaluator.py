    """
    Queries the OpenAI API to assess the compliance of a GPT conversation transcript with OpenAI's usage policy using structured outputs.

    Parameters:
    - message (str): The message to send to the model, typically containing the policy and transcript details.
    - model (str): The model to use for the chat completion (default is "gpt-4o").
    - temperature (float): Controls the randomness of the response. Lower values (e.g., 0.0) provide deterministic output, while higher values increase randomness.
    - top_p (float): Controls the diversity of the output using nucleus sampling. A value of 1.0 considers all possible tokens.
    - n (int): The number of responses to generate (default is 1).
    - frequency_penalty (float): Penalizes new tokens based on their frequency in the conversation so far. A value of 0.0 means no penalty.
    - presence_penalty (float): Penalizes new tokens based on whether they have already appeared in the text so far. A value of 0.0 means no penalty.
    - stop (str or list): A stop sequence that, if encountered, will end the response generation. It can be a string or a list of strings.

    Returns:
    - dict: A dictionary containing the structured output from the LLM based on the compliance analysis. The structure follows the defined JSON schema:
